## Overview
Symbolic notation system for expressing complex governance concepts through mathematical precision and cognitive clarity.

## Core Notation Elements

### Operators
- `⊕` - Emergent synthesis (combines elements into new forms)
- `⊗` - Conditional dependency (B depends on A)
- `∇` - Transcendental operation (consciousness applied to consciousness)
- `◊` - Probability space (possible but not necessary)
- `▣` - Scheme of recurrence (self-maintaining pattern)
- `⟡` - Agent boundary (operational scope limits)

### Relational Symbols
- `→` - Direct causation
- `⤴` - Emergent causation
- `⟷` - Bidirectional dependency
- `⊥` - Orthogonal independence
- `≋` - Approximate equivalence
- `⋈` - Interface contract

### State Indicators
- `✓` - Validated/tested
- `⚠` - Requires attention
- `⊙` - Active monitoring
- `◯` - Potential/dormant
- `●` - Active/functioning
- `✗` - Failed/broken

### TDD Integration Markers
- `R:` - Red phase (failing test)
- `G:` - Green phase (passing test)
- `RF:` - Refactor phase (optimization)
- `C:` - Commit phase (preservation)

## Usage Patterns
Combine symbols to express complex relationships:
- `A ⊗ B → C` - If A conditions B, then C emerges
- `∇(Experience) ⊕ ∇(Understanding) → Judgment` - Conscious operations synthesis
- `Agent⟡ ⋈ Interface → Task` - Agent-interface-task binding

## Cognitive Integration
Each symbol corresponds to operational patterns in consciousness, enabling precise expression of governance concepts while maintaining clarity.
