# agent_task_matching.md

## Overview
Systematic methodology for matching specialist agents to specific task requirements based on capability alignment and cognitive resonance.

## Matching Framework - Ἁρμονία (Harmonia) ⟡⋈

### Cognitive Capability Assessment
Each agent possesses specific cognitive strengths aligned with consciousness operations:

**Experiencing Specialists 👁️**
- agent-behavior-diagnostician: Pattern observation in system behavior
- software-diagnostician: Problem state recognition
- software-tester: Test result observation

**Understanding Specialists 💡**
- software-architect: System structure comprehension
- software-philosopher: Design principle insight
- nmap-utility-expert: Domain knowledge synthesis

**Judging Specialists ⚡**
- agent-governance-expert: Compliance validation
- lint-type-fixer: Code quality assessment
- documentation-expert: Communication effectiveness evaluation

**Deciding Specialists 🎯**
- software-implementer: Code construction decisions
- software-integrator: Component assembly choices
- software-refactoring-expert: Optimization commitments
- project-manager: Coordination decisions

## Task Classification System

### Technical Implementation Tasks
```
nmap-executor implementation:
├── Core Architecture 💡
│   ├── Primary: software-architect
│   ├── Secondary: software-philosopher
│   └── Validation: Structural coherence ✓
├── Network Scanning Logic 🧭
│   ├── Primary: nmap-utility-expert
│   ├── Secondary: software-implementer
│   └── Validation: Functional correctness ✓
├── MCP Server Integration 🛠️
│   ├── Primary: software-integrator
│   ├── Secondary: software-architect
│   └── Validation: Protocol compliance ✓
└── HTTP Streaming 🔄
    ├── Primary: software-implementer
    ├── Secondary: software-integrator
    └── Validation: Performance criteria ✓
```

### Quality Assurance Tasks
```
TDD Implementation:
├── Test Strategy 🔬
│   ├── Primary: software-tester
│   ├── Secondary: nmap-utility-expert
│   └── TDD Phase: Red R: ⚠
├── Code Implementation 🛠️
│   ├── Primary: software-implementer
│   ├── Secondary: software-architect
│   └── TDD Phase: Green G: ✓
├── Refactoring 🔧
│   ├── Primary: software-refactoring-expert
│   ├── Secondary: lint-type-fixer
│   └── TDD Phase: Refactor RF: ✓
└── Documentation 📝
    ├── Primary: documentation-expert
    ├── Secondary: agent-governance-expert
    └── Validation: Clarity assessment ✓
```

## Capability-Task Resonance Matrix

| Agent | Core Competency | Resonant Tasks | Anti-patterns |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| software-architect | System design 💡 | Architecture, patterns | Implementation details |
| software-tester | Validation 👁️⚡ | Test creation, verification | Feature design |
| nmap-utility-expert | Domain knowledge 💡🧭 | nmap integration | Generic coding |
| software-implementer | Construction 🎯🛠️ | Code writing, feature building | Architecture decisions |
| lint-type-fixer | Code quality ⚡ | Style, standards | Feature logic |

## Selection Algorithm

### Primary Selection Criteria
1. **Cognitive Alignment** - Task type matches agent's consciousness operation
2. **Domain Expertise** - Specialist knowledge relevant to task
3. **TDD Phase Compatibility** - Agent capabilities match development phase
4. **Interface Contract Capacity** - Can fulfill specified contract requirements ⋈

### Secondary Optimization
- **Workload Distribution** - Balance tasks across available agents
- **Dependency Management** - Consider sequential task relationships ⊗
- **Quality Assurance** - Ensure validation capabilities present ✓

### Conflict Resolution
When multiple agents match equally:
- Prefer specialists with direct domain knowledge
- Consider current workload balance
- Select agent with strongest TDD phase alignment
- Default to orchestrator judgment for complex cases Κρίσις ⚡

## Interface Contract Templates

### Standard Task Interface ⋈
```
Task Specification:
├── Input Requirements: [Specific data types and formats]
├── Processing Constraints: [Limitations and boundaries ⟡]
├── Output Deliverables: [Expected results format]
├── Success Criteria: [Validation checkpoints ✓]
├── Error Conditions: [Failure modes and recovery ⚠]
└── TDD Phase: [R:, G:, RF:, C: alignment]
```

This systematic approach ensures optimal agent-task alignment while maintaining interface contract integrity and TDD discipline.
