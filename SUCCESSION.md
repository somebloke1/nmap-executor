## Τετράς (Tetras) ⊕ Operational State

### 1. **Experiencing (Αἴσθησις)** - Current Data State
```yaml
project_context:
  name: nmap-executor
  type: MCP server
  language: Python
  environment: Linux WSL2
  git_status: No repo initialized
  transports: [stdio, HTTP_streaming]
  
observed_patterns:
  - User requires operational continuity
  - Succession protocol needed for session management
  - Integration with governance structure required
  
data_gathered:
  - CLAUDE.md orchestrator authority structure
  - Tetras four-fold consciousness pattern
  - TDD cognitive imperative requirements
  - User intent for succession commands
```

### 2. **Understanding (Σύνεσις)** - Pattern Recognition State
```yaml
architectural_insights:
  - Succession protocol must embody Tetras pattern
  - Governance integration requires initialization hooks
  - Command system needs explicit succession control
  - Operational state preservation across sessions critical
  
recognized_dependencies:
  - SUCCESSION.md for persistent operational state
  - current-context.md for session-specific tracking
  - CLAUDE.md governance revision for integration
  - Command handlers for write_succession/read_succession
```

### 3. **Judging (Κρίσις)** - Validation State
```yaml
validated_requirements:
  - User intent: Operational continuity ✓
  - Technical approach: File-based succession ✓
  - Integration method: Governance hooks ✓
  - Command interface: Explicit user control ✓
  
pending_validations:
  - SUCCESSION.md structure completeness
  - current-context.md design adequacy
  - Governance integration points
  - Command handler implementation
```

### 4. **Deciding (Προαίρεσις)** - Commitment State
```yaml
committed_actions:
  - Implement succession protocol with dual-file approach
  - Integrate read_succession into governance initialization
  - Provide explicit command control for succession management
  - Maintain Tetras pattern alignment throughout

active_decisions:
  - File structure design in progress
  - Governance revision pending
  - Command integration planned
  - Testing strategy deferred
```

## Specialist Agent Coordination State
```yaml
active_agents: []
interface_contracts: []
delegation_patterns: []
binding_protocols: []
```

## TDD Cognitive State
```yaml
current_phase: RED
test_status: "Succession protocol requirements defined"
minimal_solution: "File-based succession with governance integration"
refactor_target: "Command system integration"
commit_readiness: false
```

## Operational Focus
```yaml
primary_objective: "Implement succession protocol for operational continuity"
secondary_objectives:
  - "Integrate succession reading into governance initialization"
  - "Provide user command control for succession management"
  - "Maintain philosophical alignment with Tetras pattern"

critical_path:
  - SUCCESSION.md structure ← CURRENT
  - current-context.md design
  - Command handler implementation
  - Governance integration
  - Testing and validation
```

## Session Continuity Markers
```yaml
session_transition_state: "DESIGNING_SUCCESSION_PROTOCOL"
operational_momentum: "HIGH"
context_preservation_priority: "CRITICAL"
governance_integration_status: "PLANNING"
```
