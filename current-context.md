## Session Operational Context

**Session Start**: 2025-09-01
**Current Time**: Active Session
**Orchestrator Status**: OPERATIONAL
**Session Phase**: SUCCESSION_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION

## Immediate Operational Focus
```yaml
primary_task: "Implementing succession protocol for operational continuity"
active_subtask: "Designing current-context.md for session state tracking"
next_action: "Implement command integration for succession control"
```

## Active Todo State
```yaml
total_tasks: 6
completed: 2
in_progress: 1
pending: 3
current_momentum: "HIGH"
```

## Session Decisions Made
```yaml
architecture_decisions:
  - "Dual-file succession approach (SUCCESSION.md + current-context.md)"
  - "Tetras pattern alignment in succession structure"
  - "Governance integration via read_succession initialization"
  
implementation_decisions:
  - "YAML-structured operational state capture"
  - "Command-based succession control for user"
  - "File-based persistence for cross-session continuity"
```

## Recent Context Evolution
```yaml
session_progression:
  1. "Initialized with orchestrator authority structure"
  2. "Analyzed user intent for succession protocol requirements"
  3. "Designed SUCCESSION.md with Tetras operational state structure"
  4. "Currently designing current-context.md for session tracking"
  
key_insights:
  - "User requires operational continuity, not just context preservation"
  - "Succession protocol must integrate with governance initialization"
  - "Command system needed for explicit succession control"
```

## Immediate Cognitive State
```yaml
tetras_position:
  experiencing: "Session state design patterns"
  understanding: "Succession protocol requirements and structure"
  judging: "Implementation approach validation ongoing"
  deciding: "Command integration strategy planning"
  
tdd_cycle: "RED - Requirements defined, implementation in progress"
```

## Session Environment
```yaml
project_state:
  files_modified: ["SUCCESSION.md", "current-context.md"]
  files_planned: ["CLAUDE.md (revision)"]
  git_status: "No repo initialized"
  
operational_readiness:
  specialist_agents: "Available for delegation"
  interface_contracts: "Ready for establishment"
  coordination_patterns: "Active"
```

## Context Preservation Markers
```yaml
session_health: "HEALTHY"
operational_coherence: "HIGH"
succession_readiness: "BUILDING"
user_alignment: "CONFIRMED"
```
